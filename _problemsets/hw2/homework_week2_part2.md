# _Python for Scientific Data Analysis_

## Homework - Week 2 (part 2 of 2) (due Sept 9)

### Part 2: Data Structures

### 6. Dictionaries

Use three defined dictionaries with the following entries -- 1. city + country abbreviation, 2. country abbreviation + skyscraper, 3. skyscraper + height.   

Assume the following building heights (i.e. this will be dictionary number 3):
 Petronas Towers - 1483 ft
 WTC - 1776 ft
 Eiffel Tower - 1083 ft
 
 Write a for-loop that prints out the country, abbreviation, city, building, and height converted to au (assume 1 foot = 2.0375e-12 au):
 
 ```
The tallest building in the city of Paris, FR is the Eiffel Tower with a height of 2.207e-09 au
The tallest building in the city of New York, USA is the WTC with a height of 3.619e-09 au
The tallest building in the city of Kuala Lumpur, MY is the Petronas Towers with a height of 3.022e-09 au
 ```

### 7. Lists, Arrays, Loops and Type Conversions:

Start with a list 4 elements long, including a mix of floating point numbers and integers: $\pi$, e, 3.1 and 5.

Remove 3.1 using the ``remove`` function and array indexing.  

Append Euler's gamma constant to the list

Write a line of code that prints out ``a``, repeated 3 times

Write a line of code that prints out each element of ``a`` multiplied by 3

Write a for-loop that prints out each element of ``a`` multiplied by 3

### 8. Slicing 

Consider the array:

``a=[2,3,5,6,8,9,10]``

Use slicing to produce the following:

 ``[2,5,8,10]``
 
 ``[6,8,9]``
 
 ``[10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 3, 2]``
 
### 9. Slicing 
 
 Convert ``a`` to an array and then use conditional/boolean slicing to print out
 
 ``array([ 6,  8,  9, 10])``
 
 
 ``array([ 2,  8,  9, 10])``
