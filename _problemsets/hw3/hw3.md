# _Python for Scientific Data Analysis_

## Homework 3 (due September 16)

### 1. Sequence Function

Consider three lists -- episode=['Best of Both Worlds','Darmok','Chain of Command Pt 2']; line=["Mr Worf, Fire!","Shaka, when the walls fell", "THERE ARE ... FOUR LIGHTS!"]; season = [3,5,6]

Use the ``zip`` sequence function and other operations in a for-loop to produce the following output:

```
The best line of the episode Best of Both Worlds in season 3 was "mr worf, fire!" 
The best line of the episode Darmok in season 5 was "shaka, when the walls fell" 
The best line of the episode Chain of Command Pt 2 in season 6 was "there are ... four lights!"
```

### 2. Sequence Functions
 
 Consider the example shown in the data struct part 3 notes of the list comprehension for four stars wth different names ``HIP 99770, AF Lep, HR 8799, Vega.``.  It used ``zip`` to advance each element of starname, spectype, starmag, and dstar 
 
 Now, add the use of ``enumerate`` to write a for-loop printing out the number of the star in the list and an indexed version of``absmag`` at each interation and then print the full array of ``absmag`` outside of the for-loop.  Your answer should look like this when you run the code:
 
```
The absolute magnitude of star number 1 with name HIP 99770 with spectral type A5V is 1.850
The absolute magnitude of star number 2 with name AF Lep with spectral type F8V is 4.159
The absolute magnitude of star number 3 with name HR 8799 with spectral type F0V is 2.923
The absolute magnitude of star number 4 with name Vega with spectral type A0V is 0.568
```
as before, and then

```
[1.84989488 4.15932603 2.92251889 0.56754637]
```
outside of the loop.


 
 
### 3. List Comprehensions
 
 Consider a list ``vals=[.1,2,.4,3]``
 
 Write a list comprehension returning a variable ``vals2`` which equals ``[6,9]`` (i.e. vals[1] and vals[3] each times 3) using the value of 1/x versus 1/x$^{2}$ for each element ``x`` of ``vals`` as the conditional.
 

 

### 4. NumPy Array Creation 

Create a 4x3 dimension NumPy array filled with random numbers called ``multi_array``

Use a NumPy Function and array slicing to create a second array called ``multi_array2`` with the same dimensions as ``multi_array`` but with the 0th column of the array filled with ones (``1's``).


### 5. NumPy Slicing with Boolean Indexing

Read in file ``spectrum_oct17_adi.dat`` from the notes using ``np.loadtxt``.   It has columns of wavelength, flux density, uncertainty (flux density), and signal-to-noise ratio.   

 Use the ``np.where`` statement to replace the values for uncertainty (flux density) by ``-9`` for rows where the signal-to-noise ratio is less than 5.

Save a new file with columns of wavelength, flux density, uncertainty (flux density), and signal-to-noise ratio, where you have updated the uncertainty values.

### 6. Array Reshaping 

Another trick we can do with NumPy is the function ``linspace`` (i.e. ``np.linspace``), which returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.   ``linspace`` gets very useful when we want to do looping or interpolation.

Read up on it here: [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html]()

Create one array using ``np.linspace`` with 100 values between 5 and 10: i.e. ``np.linspace(5,10,num=100)``.  

Then convert this row vector to a column vector called ``a_col`` using ``reshape``.  

Then convert ``a_col`` into a 2-D array called ``a_2d`` (i.e. a matrix) with 20 rows.

Then use ``transpose`` to convert the 2-D array into a new one called ``a_2dt`` that has 20 columns.

Then convert it back to a row vector called ``a_flat`` using ``flatten``.



### 7. (Grad Students Only; Extra Credit for Undergrads) 

In addition to ``np.loadtxt`` there's a key NumPy function called ``np.genfromtxt``, which is supposed to treat missing table entries.  However, sometimes it fails to parse missing entries correctly (search StackOverFlow topics on this for some examples).  So when presented with a table containing missing values, sometimes we have to improvise.

Load the file ``test.csv``

**Without using a for-loop** ...

 * clean missing entries for semimajor axis (i.e. entries that just have a `` ''`` ... set them to a negative number)
 
 * for entries that do NOT have a missing semimajor axis, compute the median semimajor axis for planets discovered using ... a) Imaging, b) Radial Velocity, and c) Transit.

Hints:
 
 * you will need to use ``np.where`` multiple times;       
 
 * after cleaning the data, you will need use ``astype`` to convert key variables to floating point else you may get a ``TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'numpy.ndarray' and 'int'`` error
