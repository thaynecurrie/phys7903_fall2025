    "Programs need to do repetitive things very quickly.   If you only want to do an operation, say, twice then you could just copy and paste the same operation text on subsequent lines.  What about 3 times?   A bit more annoying -- especially if you want to change subtle things about the operation each time --  but possible.   10,000 times?   No way.   Hence, we need a way of _loop_-ing an operation.    And that's where _Loops_ come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward version of a _loop_-ing operation is a ```for-loop```.  A ```for-loop``` means literally that: \"for [some number of iterations], do the following block of code\".   Like if-else statements, the block of code following the loop designation is indented."

The line _stuff.pop()_ prints out and removes the last array element of _stuff_.  \n",

You don't need to worry about the details of these right now.  Just know that we can do far more complex loop-like operations dealing with multiple variables in Python.\n",
